This was a project created by Areeb Rehman and Subham Jena. The point of this project was to create a frontend and backend in order to analyze the sentiment of a specific stock based on news headlines.

To Run:

Simply navigate to the same directory as the react project and run "npm start"

After that run the sentimentAPI.py file in order to ensure the frontend can communicate with the backend.

Note: None of these readings are reflections of realtime stock data and should not be used as financial advice. Instead it reflects how positively or negatively the AI model perceives certain headlines and descriptions.

Libraries Used:

React(Frontend)
MUI
Flask(Backend)
NewsAPI(To gather news headlines)
torch
transformers
collections
datetime
