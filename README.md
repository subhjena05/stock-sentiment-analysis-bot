Developed by Subham Jena and Areeb Rehman, the purpose of this project was to create a frontend and backend in order to analyze the sentiment of a specific stock based on news headlines available on the web.

To Run:
1. Navigate to the same directory as the react project and run "npm start".
2. Afterward, run the sentimentAPI.py file in order to ensure the frontend can communicate with the backend.
